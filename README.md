FairyGate | Identity-Based Privacy Layer

**FairyGate** is an innovative prototype of a decentralized gateway for confidential data transmission, built on the principles of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)

The project is designed to demonstrate how **Fairblock** technology can provide data access exclusively to a specific wallet owner, eliminating the need for traditional passwords


##  MVP Status & Concept
This project is a **functional MVP** designed to demonstrate the real-world application of decentralized privacy.

* **Current Focus**: User Experience (UX), seamless Web3 integration, and end-to-end logic flow
* **Technical Objective**: To showcase the power of **Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)**. By leveraging the **Fairyring** infrastructure, FairyGate enables a "Push-button Privacy" model where a user's wallet address (Identity) serves as the public key
* **The Goal**: Eliminate the "Interactive Setup" bottleneck. Unlike traditional encryption, FairyGate allows sending confidential data to recipients who are offline or haven't yet registered their encryption keys, significantly lowering the barrier for mass Web3 adoption



 
 Core Features (MVP)

* **Identity-Locked Messages**: Data encryption tied to a specific wallet address (Target Identity)
* **Web3 Authentication**: Full integration with MetaMask and the Ethereum Sepolia network
* **On-chain Anchoring**: Each encryption process is accompanied by a testnet transaction to anchor the "Intent."
* **Automated Verification**: The system automatically verifies the current user's signature and permits decryption only to the legitimate recipient
* **Time-Lock Logic**: The interface is pre-configured to implement scheduled data revelation (Time-lock encryption)
